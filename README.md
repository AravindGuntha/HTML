<h2>HTML Stands for HyperText Markup Language</h2> 
<p>This File here, that is the README.md -> .md represents that this is a Markdown Language. And it has similar syntaxs as HTML</p>
<br>

HTML is basically used to create a WebPage. <br>
Everything in HTML is a tag "<>" is used as TAG<br>
Tags are of two types,<br>
1. Paired Tag -> it contains the Opening Tag and Closing Tag. <br>
2. Un-paired / Single Tag -> it doesn't have the closing Tag. It's a independent tag.<br>
<br>
Each tag & Data enclosed in between them is addressed as an Element.<br>
We can categorize/identify the tags in two ways<br>
1. By Class <br>
2. By Id <br>
This categorization gives flexibility to customize the tags. And in the later purposes we also use this fetch the content of any tag (in java script.)<br>

Creating a WebPage comprises of a lot of things,<br>
1. Arranging the elements - meaning, which element takes which place in the page<br>
2. Styling the element - what size and color the element needs to be in<br>
3. Adding the behaviour for each element - what happens when particular element is being clicked. <br>
<br><br>
Every HTML file contains the extension as .html<br>
In general, while coding for any WebApplication, the first page of it would be named as<br>
index.html<br>
<br>
As we progress in the process of building a webapplication, it would need more webpages, and these can be developed/coded separately and can be connected where it's needed.

Please look into the different html files to dwell deep into the HTML.
