<!--this talks about: 
    proving html is not case sensitive.
    and defining what an attribute is.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"><!-- here lang is called as an attribute. 
    An attribute is a thing which adds more information to a tag.
    it's not necessary that all the tags contain the attirbutes.-->
    <head>
        <title>Second HTML page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p><!-- This here is called as a paragraph tag-->
        <P>This is also a paragraph</P> <!-- This is also a pragaraph, 
        so, this means that HTML is not case sensitive, meaning <html> == <HTML>
            -->
    </body>
</html>
