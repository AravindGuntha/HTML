<!--This page talks about:  
    br tag
    and tags that are used to format the text written in the html-->

        <title>Fifth html page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>If you have observed in the last page that is in the Fourth page, 
           even though we have written the content in the multiple lines, we are getting all the 
           lines of code in a single line.
        </p>
        please click here to re-visit<a href="./fourth.html">Previous Page</a>
        <p>So, by default HTML compresses the extra spaces, lines
           unless it's said in the HTML language.
           To tell, the webpage to add extra spaces or lines we need to use a separate tag.
           and that's called as a BREAK tag / Tab Sapce tag.
           <!-- <br> is a break tag and it's a unpaired tag, meaning it doesn't contain the closing tag-->
        </p>
        <p>so, where ever we would need to have the content in the new line, we use the Breaktag.<br>
            As, i've used the break tag this line would be shown in the new line.</p>
        <p>if you have rightly observed, we have used the break tag INSIDE of the paragraph tag, 
            it means that we can combine any number of tags and use it together. <br>
            we can use the Image tag inside of the anchor tag -> which means that we can go to any page by clicking on the image.
        </p>

        <!--to separate the content we can use the HR tag, that allows to seprate the content by placing a horizantal ruler-->
        <hr>
        <h4>We'll now see how to format the text</h4>
        <p>We can bold the text, italicise the text, underline the text</p>
        <b>This "B" tag is used to make the text inside this tag to be BOLD</b><br>
        <i>This "I" tag is used to make the text inside this tag to be ITALIC</i><br>
        <u>This "U" tag is used to make the text inside this tag to be UNDERLINED</u><br>
        <br>
        we can make all these three formatting to a single text, please try and see.
