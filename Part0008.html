            Here block element means - elements that take the complete width of a page
            and inline element means - elements that take the actual width that suffice to put the content.

                <!--DIV is a container tag & a block element.
                    which in general is used to group a set of elements under one section.
                    On the other hand, when we talk about the Section tag.
                    it is used to divide the page into meaningful section, like a chapter
                    in the usage, both reacts in the same way, but to have a meaning 
                    we use section s in the body as per the need
                    and div in the section if we need to style few elements together.
                To elaborate, let's talk a real time scenario.

                Let's say we have to build a page, 
                where it should contain the Signup & Login buttons, logo of the page,
                offers in the store, products in the store, history of orders, profile, items, feed back,
                contact info. 

                So, to properly arrage all these items we need divide our page into multiple parts.
                1. Header -> where we can have the Signup/Login, profile, order history and such items.
                2. Footer -> where we can place feedback, grievance, and contact info
                3. And keep all the items in the Main -> where in we can use sections to separate different items
                   like we can use one section for holding the grocerries, other section for footware,
                   other for watch and etc. 
                   and we can hold all the items at mrp in one div and style them as we need.
                   and we can hold all the offer items into other div and style them in other way as we need.
