<h2>HTML Stands for HyperText Markup Language</h2> 
<p>This File here, that is the README.md -> .md represents that this is a Markdown Language. And it has similar syntaxs as HTML</p>

HTML is basically used to create a WebPage. <br>
Everything in HTML is a tag <br>
Tags are of two types,<br>
1. Paired Tag -> it contains the Opening Tag and Closing Tag. <br>
2. Un-paired / Single Tag -> it doesn't have the closing Tag. It's a independent tag.<br>
<br>
Each tag is addressed as an Element.
