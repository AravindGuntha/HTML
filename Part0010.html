            And use this information as per the need
            So, Login Page, Signin Page, Request Page, Contact Me page
            all these things are possible by using the Forms.
            Let's say Login page - we collect this information and check if the user is genuine
            Similarly, Request Page -> we collect this information to know the request of the user.

            <!--so, in this overall episode, we have provided class & id attributes
                Let's learn that now. 
                Class & Ids are something called as Identifiers/Categorizers 
                Meaning, if we want to group a few items under one category, we can use Class
                and if we want to identify any single item by we can assign an Id
                
                Everytag, can have, both the Class and Id
                many tags can have one class name, 
                but different tags cannot have same same ids
                
                We categorize these to apply styling, get to know values in that class etc.
