        <!-- Let's say we have to write a paragarph, where in we wanted to use a lot of 
         indentations, line breaks and so on.., is using the break tags only way we have.
        No, we have a tag called as PRE tag which is used to let the system know we wanted 
        to read the content in between this tag as it is written/coded,
        meaning if we write two words with multiple spaces, outside of a PRE tag it compresses to a single space
        but PRE Tag potrays the information as it is with multiple space, as below.-->
        <pre>
            hello.,              how are you doing today, we have used multiple space.
            Now, i've used a new line to write a content without using the "BR" tag, 
            that is all possible by using the "PRE" tag.
